# SudokuSolver
I created 2 different version of SudokuSolver that uses different methods to get the result
Sudoku board: list[list[int]], empty spaces are depicted with 0
SudokuSolver.py uses backtracking to solve the board
SudokuSolverV2 uses A* search (Heuristics and MRV)

Example board:
board = [
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0, 2, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 7, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8],
    [0, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]
]
